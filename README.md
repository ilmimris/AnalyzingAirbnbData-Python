# AnalyzingAirbnbData
In this project, I've analyzed open data of Airbnb provided on Kaggle. I've also used Hotels data and Twitter Data to support my analysis.

# Introduction

For the purpose of this analysis, I am using Boston's Airbnb data provided on Kaggle by Airbnb itself as part of an open competition.
I'll be asking following questions while performing my 5 analysis on this dataset:

Markup :  1. How does neighborhood affect distribution of listings in Boston area?
          2. Why would anyone prefer to stay in Airbnb over hotels while visting Boston?
          3. How the sentiments of customers are over the social media after their stay at Airbnb in Boston?
          4. Are you more likely to be airbnb if you own Condominium rather than Apartment? Boats are pretty famous too ib Boston, but would anyone want to stay in a boat than a regular apartment?
            1. What's the most likey room-type?
            2. Which kind of bed to expect in those rooms?
          5.
